/** 
 * mismatch_and_alignment
 *
 * This function performs two operations:
 * - Computes the Levenshtein distance between a specified substring of s1,
 *    and s2, up to a maximum bound on edit operations
 * - Determines the best alignment of s2 to the full s1, also bounded by a
 *    different number of edit operations.
 *
 * The Levenshtein distance is computed up to length barcode_length characters
 * of s2. If there is a match within barcode_length, continue processing for
 * all of the length of s1 and determine the aligned length of s2 (this is 
 * used to know how much to trim).
 *
 * If there are more characters left in s2 after all characters in s1 are used,
 * there is no penalty for these extra characters.
 *
 * This algorithm is faster than a naive approach, as it applies the max_val
 * bounds at every step, excluding a lot of computations which are guaranteed
 * to yield a distance above or equal to max_val. It aborts as soon as there
 * is no chance of getting a value below max_val.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  max_val_barcode: The max value to return for Levenshtein distance of 
 *                   barcode (all higher values are clipped). Such a
 *                   threshold is relevant only for performance reasons.
 *  max_val_align:   Limit of edit operations allowed for alignment of the
 *                   whole sequence of s1. This parameter works similarly
 *                   to max_val_barcode, but the distance of the full string
 *                   alignment is not actually returned. Instead, if alignment
 *                   reaches this value, the aligned distance of zero is
 *                   returned.
 *  barcode_length:  Length of substring of s1 to use for barcode comparison.
 *                   The bound max_val_barcode is only applied to this sequence.
 *  s1:              The first string, representing the known index and spacer
 *                   sequence, concatenated.
 *  s2:              The data to examine for alignment and mismatches. The full
 *                   length read can be passed without performance impact.
 *                   
 *
 * Returns:
 *  first:  The edit distance between s2 and substring(s1, 0, barcode_length),
 *          using the best matching substring of s2 (starting at 0). If the
 *          distance exceeds max_val_barcode, that value is returned instead.
 *  second: The length of s2 when aligned to the full sequence of s1. The length
 *          of the match with fewest edit operations is returned. If several
 *          matches have equal distance, the shortest match is returned (please
 *          see loop before return statement, this could change). If the edit
 *          distance of the barcode is greater or equal to max_val_barcode, the
 *          value of second is undefined. If the total number of edit operations is
 *          equal or greater than max_val_align, the value zero is returned.
