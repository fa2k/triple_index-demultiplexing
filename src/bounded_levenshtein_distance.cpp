/**
 * Computes the Levenshtein distance between s1 and s2, up to a maximum
 * bound max_val.
 *
 * If there are more characters in s2 after all characters in s1 are used,
 * there is no penalty for these extra characters. This means it only computes
 * the levenshtein distance between s1 and a substring of s2 (this is more
 * relevant for our problem than the true levenshtein distance).
 *
 * This algorithm is faster than a naive approach, as it applies the max_val
 * bound at every step, excluding a lot of computations which are guaranteed
 * to yield a distance above or equal to max_val. It aborts as soon as there
 * is no chance of getting a value below max_val.
 *
 * If parameter return_length is set, it returns the length of the aligned
 * match of s2 to s1, instead of the number of mismatches.
